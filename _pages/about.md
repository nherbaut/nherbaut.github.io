## About me

I'm an Associate Professor in Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, in the CRI lab. I'm with the French Computer Science Learned Society (Société Informatique de France) and an IEEE member.

## Where I come from

Before, was a PostDoc in Distributed Systems in the ERODS team of CNRS/LIG lab in Grenoble in France. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Bordeaux University in November 2017, where I was a graduate teaching assistant at ENSEIRB Bordeaux INP. I was a visiting student at the University College of Dublin, Ireland, in the Performance Engineering Lab.

I worked as a R&D Engineer, Team and Project manager for 10 years in the software industry, owning a M.Eng (Math) form INSA Rouen, France and a M.Econ from Aix-Marseille University/EHESS.

## Current Activities

My research interests are Network Softwarization (SDN, NFV),  blockchain, Intent-based Networking, Content delivery and Techno-Economics.

I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to a project, volunteer for a good cause or collaborate to a scientific article. Feel free to contact me: nicolas.herbaut ([at}) univ-paris1.fr
