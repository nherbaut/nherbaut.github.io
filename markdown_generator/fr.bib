abstract="
This position paper explores the sustainability of ubiquitous AI through a socio-metabolic lens. We present
a metabolic model, adapted from social metabolism theory, to analyze the relationships between resource
flows, infrastructures, and societal needs driven by AI. The model highlights feedback loops and externalities
that challenge the long-term viability of current AI. We suggest three systemic scenarios—degrowth, collapse,
and controlled landing—and question the plausibility of the latter. The research goal is to determine whether
sustainable AI usage exists and, if so, how it might be implemented through design or regulation. This contribution
invites interdisciplinary dialogue on aligning AI development with planetary limits.

abstract="In inter-organizational business processes, divergent interests among participants often result in trust deficiencies. The question of how to initiate trust remains a largely unresolved theoretical issue. However, the advancement of Blockchain technology has led to an increase in its application for establishing trust among stakeholders in these processes. This paper introduces a conceptual model that leverages an ontology of trust to examine its significance within digital ecosystems and suggests a method to promote the integration of blockchain. We exemplify our approach with a practical industrial case study and outline prospective developments in the field of trust facilitation through blockchain technology.",

abstract="Ensuring the quality of software design is usually a difficult task. In the blockchain field, the design of an application is particularly important as flaws can lead to critical vulnerabilities and cost overheads. To assist practitioners in this task, software patterns can be used (solutions to repeatable problems in a given context). Some blockchain patterns exist but they are scattered, and described in many different notations and templates. As a result, practitioners can be lost in the selection of adequate blockchain-based patterns. This paper fills the gap by proposing a blockchain-based software pattern ontology. The ontology is composed of two distinct subspaces: first, a set of classes and individuals related to blockchain-based patterns, based on a previous Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It notably reuses a taxonomy of blockchain design patterns, that helps to classify these patterns in relevant categories. Along that, another subspace has been created to further organize the knowledge related to software patterns and allow inferences. A tool is proposed along with the ontology to assist practitioners in finding blockchain-based patterns that fit their needs. An evaluation is performed to assess the usability and the relevancy of the ontology.",
