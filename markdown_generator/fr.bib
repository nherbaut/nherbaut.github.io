abstract="Ensuring the quality of software design is usually a difficult task. In the blockchain field, the design of an application is particularly important as flaws can lead to critical vulnerabilities and cost overheads. To assist practitioners in this task, software patterns can be used (solutions to repeatable problems in a given context). Some blockchain patterns exist but they are scattered, and described in many different notations and templates. As a result, practitioners can be lost in the selection of adequate blockchain-based patterns. This paper fills the gap by proposing a blockchain-based software pattern ontology. The ontology is composed of two distinct subspaces: first, a set of classes and individuals related to blockchain-based patterns, based on a previous Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It notably reuses a taxonomy of blockchain design patterns, that helps to classify these patterns in relevant categories. Along that, another subspace has been created to further organize the knowledge related to software patterns and allow inferences. A tool is proposed along with the ontology to assist practitioners in finding blockchain-based patterns that fit their needs. An evaluation is performed to assess the usability and the relevancy of the ontology.",

abstract="Contact tracing (CT) apps have been rolled out as part of combined efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these apps haven't been download by the totality of the population, with users raising concerns over the usage of data and data protection. This article analyzes how different app providers and data protection levels can affect the willingness to download a COVID-19 contact tracing app between university students, and if there is a difference between students who downloaded and didn't download the app. Through the usage of a factorial survey experiment (FSE) the paper statistically analyses the data protection and trust (DPT) requirements, using the French COVID-19 CT as a use case. The results show that universities have a positive impact on the trust levels of app providers, while private companies tend to have a negative impact on trust. Subjects also have high expectations on data protection. Our results highlight the importance of data protection and app providers for building trust with users of CT COVID-19 apps.",
