abstract = {Blockchain has been praised for its capacity to hold data in a decentralized and tamper-proof way. It also supports the execution of code through blockchain's smart contracts, adding automation of actions to the network with high trustability. However, as smart contracts are visible by anybody on the network, the business data and logic may be at risk, thus companies could be reluctant to use such technology. This paper aims to propose a pattern that allows the execution of automatable legal contract clauses, where its execution states are stored in an on-chain smart-contract and the logic needed to enforce it wraps it off-chain. An engine completes this pattern by running a business process that corresponds to the legal contract. We then propose a pattern-based solution based on a real-life use case: transportation of refrigerated goods. We argue that this pattern guarantees companies pseudonymity and data confidentiality while ensuring that an audit trail can be reconstituted through the blockchain smart-contract to identify misbehavior or errors. This paper paves the way for a future possible implementation of the solution described, as well as its evaluation.},

abstract = {Increasing over-the-top video consumption endangers the sustainability of content delivery over the Internet. Internet Service Providers (ISP) face difficulties in competing on value-added services with content providers and Content Delivery Network (CDN) operators. In this respect, we propose a new model for the collaboration between content delivery stakeholders, so that CDN operators can deploy their software in ISP infrastructures leveraging on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). As the ISP network topology and utilization is deemed confidential, we use a high-level Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the negotiation of both computing resources and connectivity, allowing the ISP to optimize server selection, while providing at the same time sufficient flexibility to the CDN operators for content delivery. Furthermore, we present a linear programming formulation for the VNF Service Chain Embedding and an heuristic to increase problem tractability with a small cost overhead. Finally, we validate the efficiency of the proposed service chain model for virtual CDN management.},

abstract = {Today, Over-the-Top video streaming is gaining a lot of popularity. In this respect, the Virtual Content Delivery Network(CDN) is perceived as a key enabler to circumvent the technical challenges faced by Content Providers (CP) to deliver high-quality content over the Internet. In this paper, we investigate how the two main actors of the video delivery chain, i.e., the CDNoperator and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), can benefit from network and server virtualization to negotiate Dynamic ServiceLevel Agreements that reduce CDN CAPEX and OPEX, while generating more revenue for the ISP. First, we present a datasetused to simulate dynamic distributed traffic consumption. Second, we discuss the steps required to deploy and operate a virtualCDN deployed on an ISP&#x2019;s network. Furthermore, we present evaluation results of the proposed solution, based on simple models.Lastly, we elaborate on operational parameters that are used to further optimize the solution.},

abstract = {Increasing over-the-top video consumption makes the delivery of content unsustainable in the current Internet. The Internet Service Providers (ISP) have a hard time competing on value-added services with content providers and content delivery networks (CDN). We propose a new model of collaboration between content delivery actors where CDNs can deploy their software in Internet Service Providers' infrastruc-ures as NFV modules. As the ISP network state has to be kept private, a high-level SLA is used to negotiate both computing resources and connectivity, leaving it up to the ISP to optimize server placement and routes. The contribution of this paper is to formalize this problem as a Service Function Chaining Embedding problem, and to propose an algorithm to optimize the Service Function Chain to improve embedding probability and decrease consumed bandwidth in the process.},

abstract = {The switch in video delivery from traditional medium to Over-The-Top (OTT) based services has been a game changer for stakeholders of the media delivery ecosystem. It has changed the value chain enabling Content Delivery Networks and Content Providers to take the lion's share at the expense of Internet/Network Service Providers. Even if establishing collaboration between them naturally appears as the key to provide good Quality of Service to the end-users, they struggle in finding efficient and fair ways to do so. This paper directly tackles this problem and proposes a new model for content delivery actors to collaborate over a Virtualized Infrastructure, fairly balancing the revenue stream created. We list the main challenges and the new technical opportunities to solve them, among which the deployment of a distributed Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platform at the edge of the Internet Service Provider's network where a virtual Content Delivery Network (vCDN) is proposed to be deployed. Furthermore, we apply a game-theoretic analysis to study different ISP-CDN collaboration models and identify optimality conditions for our proposed CDN-as-a-Virtual-Network-Function approach.},

abstract = {Virtualizing network functions is becoming a major trend in today's research on cloud computing. Among networking elements, the Home Gateway appears to be one with the most diverse functions to handle and thus, with great potential for virtualization. To this end, the paper proposes a solution to ease adoption by Service Providers of the latest breakthroughs in cloud computing technologies towards a virtualized Home Gateway. Although the NFV approach globally pretends bringing operational advantages in terms of CAPEX and OPEX, it is essential to prove them for Home Gateways scenarios where compatibility and versatility are strong requirements. To achieve this goal, we introduce the concept of Surrogate vNF, which makes Home Gateways NFV aware. The paper highlights a migration path towards full Home Gateway virtualization and proves its concept through a real implementation and a simulated evaluation on a practical use case related to video content distribution.},
