abstract="Ensuring the quality of software design is usually a difficult task. In the blockchain field, the design of an application is particularly important as flaws can lead to critical vulnerabilities and cost overheads. To assist practitioners in this task, software patterns can be used (solutions to repeatable problems in a given context). Some blockchain patterns exist but they are scattered, and described in many different notations and templates. As a result, practitioners can be lost in the selection of adequate blockchain-based patterns. This paper fills the gap by proposing a blockchain-based software pattern ontology. The ontology is composed of two distinct subspaces: first, a set of classes and individuals related to blockchain-based patterns, based on a previous Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It notably reuses a taxonomy of blockchain design patterns, that helps to classify these patterns in relevant categories. Along that, another subspace has been created to further organize the knowledge related to software patterns and allow inferences. A tool is proposed along with the ontology to assist practitioners in finding blockchain-based patterns that fit their needs. An evaluation is performed to assess the usability and the relevancy of the ontology.",

abstract="Current practices in software testing such as Test Driven Development or Behavior Driven Development aim at linking code to expected behavior. In this context, code coverage is widely used to improve code quality, reduce bugs and ssure requirements satisfaction. Even if change tracking software allows finely analyzing code evolution, associating a particular code chunk to the requirements at the origin of the code modification is difficult for a large code base. In this preliminary work, we propose a new ``user story coverage'' metric that reports lacking requirement coverage quality, to help developers focus their efforts on enhancing unit and integration tests. We propose a methodology to compute this metric in a robust and automated fashion and evaluate its feasibility on open-source projects.",
