abstract="Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger that allows for secure, transparent, and immutable tracking of transactions. However, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution for addressing trust issues in the supply chain. In software engineering, design patterns provide a blueprint that developers can follow to solve a specific problem in a structured and efficient manner. In this paper, we identify and discuss the reusable blockchain software patterns that can be applied to design trustworthy solutions in supply chain management (SCM). Based on the literature analysis, we define a comprehensive taxonomy of SCM-specific trust issues. Then we apply requirement engineering technique to translate these issues into trust requirements and demonstrate how these requirements can be met by the specific blockchain software patterns.",

abstract="Current practices in software testing such as Test Driven Development or Behavior Driven Development aim at linking code to expected behavior. In this context, code coverage is widely used to improve code quality, reduce bugs and ssure requirements satisfaction. Even if change tracking software allows finely analyzing code evolution, associating a particular code chunk to the requirements at the origin of the code modification is difficult for a large code base. In this preliminary work, we propose a new ``user story coverage'' metric that reports lacking requirement coverage quality, to help developers focus their efforts on enhancing unit and integration tests. We propose a methodology to compute this metric in a robust and automated fashion and evaluate its feasibility on open-source projects.",
