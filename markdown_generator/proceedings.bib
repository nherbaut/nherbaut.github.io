abstract="We propose a holistic design approach that extends a traditional Model Driven Architecture paradigm with the bottom-up constraint analysis and propagation. We define a Unified Feature Model that represents the organizational goals and the technical properties of the solution, and use model-checking to reason about the constraints that arise from their interplay. In the illustrative example, we show how the technical decisions specified in a Feature Model can be formalized, validated, and translated into strategic limits of a Goal Model for further redesign of both business and technical enterprise models.",

abstract="In inter-organizational business processes, divergent interests among participants often result in trust deficiencies. The question of how to initiate trust remains a largely unresolved theoretical issue. However, the advancement of Blockchain technology has led to an increase in its application for establishing trust among stakeholders in these processes. This paper introduces a conceptual model that leverages an ontology of trust to examine its significance within digital ecosystems and suggests a method to promote the integration of blockchain. We exemplify our approach with a practical industrial case study and outline prospective developments in the field of trust facilitation through blockchain technology.",

abstract="Current practices in software testing such as Test Driven Development or Behavior Driven Development aim at linking code to expected behavior. In this context, code coverage is widely used to improve code quality, reduce bugs and ssure requirements satisfaction. Even if change tracking software allows finely analyzing code evolution, associating a particular code chunk to the requirements at the origin of the code modification is difficult for a large code base. In this preliminary work, we propose a new ``user story coverage'' metric that reports lacking requirement coverage quality, to help developers focus their efforts on enhancing unit and integration tests. We propose a methodology to compute this metric in a robust and automated fashion and evaluate its feasibility on open-source projects.",
