extract from our recently [published paper](https://nextnet.top/files/SAIaaS:%20A%20Blockchain-based%20solution%20for%20secure%20artificial%20intelligence%20as-a-Service.pdf) in DEEP-BDB-2021, for which we [publish a Demo](nextnet.top/semantic-configurator-mktplace/).

A client's request contains requested *asset specifications* for data, algorithms and infrastructure on the blockchain system for service composition.
Since we aim to build a use case-agnostic system, we must support a wide and dynamic range of application domains.
To this end, we rely on an ontology-based resource retrieval and allocation system, which have already been proposed in the literature for cloud services provisioning \cite{ma2011ontology} or dataset \cite{kushiro2013method} discovery.

With a common ontology used to describe both client requirements and providers assets, matchmaking can be done on-chain, through the emission of a specific event targeted at providers that can fulfill client requests or off-chain, through the continuous monitoring of new clientsâ€™ requests publicly available on the blockchain.
Based on the asset ontology, each provider can analyze the *asset specifications* published by the client and know if it owns a matching asset, in which case it will take part in the auction phase through *asset bids*
