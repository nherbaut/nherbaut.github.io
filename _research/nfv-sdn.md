I Implemented and deployed several of Virtual Network Functions during the FP7 EU T-NOVA Project.

During this project, I got my hands dirty with OpenStack, OpenDayLight and the TeNOR Orchestrator, and cloud platform EC2, GAE.

I got familiar with the current standards of ETSI NVF, IETF Service Function Chaining and other supporting technologies such as ONOS, Ryu SDN controllers.
