I'm interested in understanding the relationship between technical, organizational and economics aspects of online streaming platforms.

The [Stream For Good](https://stream-for-good.miage.dev/) and [Prime-space](https://www.vod-prime.space/en/) projects involves collectings, analyzing and making sense out of streaming platforms data, including recommender systems and user-experience factors that influence end-user behaviour. With with crowd-sourced data, we apply process-mining techniques to better understand how regulatory frameworks could be adapted to non-linear data consumption to support diversity. In collaboration with the "[Chaire PcEn](https://pcen.fr)"

I'm currently working on the following projects: 

* using process mining to analyze platform traces for legal conformity
* using AI to understand how conspiracy theories are handled by public video platforms recommender systems.
