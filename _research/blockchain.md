I'm studying how next generation blockchain can help support today's Information Systems through its role in Entreprise Architecture, Buniness Process Management and Privacy Patterns.

The [BLADE project](https://recommender.blade-blockchain.eu/) aims to help companies choose between available blockchains. From a set of requirements, this automated process will compute the most desirable blockchain alternative for your project.

Blockchain Systems for data exchange also bring additional issues for privacy, that we address in our [current research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08997.pdf)
