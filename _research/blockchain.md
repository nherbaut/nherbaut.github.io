I'm studying how next generation blockchain can help support today's Information Systems through its role in Enterprise Architecture, Business Process Management and Privacy Patterns.

The [BLADE project](https://recommender.blade-blockchain.eu/) aims at helping companies choosing between available blockchains solutions. From a set of requirements, this automated process will compute the most desirable blockchain alternative for your project.

Blockchain Systems for data exchange also bring additional issues for privacy that we address in our [current research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08997.pdf) and for which more work in ongoing.
