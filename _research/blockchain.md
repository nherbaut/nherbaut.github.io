I'm studying how next generation blockchain can help support today's Information Systems through its role in Data Management, Enterprise Architecture, Business Process Management and Privacy Patterns.

## Current research

The [BLADE project](https://recommender.blade-blockchain.eu/) aims at helping companies choose between available blockchains solutions. From a set of requirements, this automated process will compute the most desirable blockchain alternative for your project.

In the [Harmonica Project](https://it4.miage.dev/), we've built a Software Pattern ontology based on our [Systematic Literature Review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100061) and derived a pattern ontology to infer new knowledge on pattern recommendations.
